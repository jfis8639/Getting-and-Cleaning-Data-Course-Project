## Introduction ##

This Github repository submits a course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course from John Hopkins University. It contains: 

* run_analysis.R script
* CodeBook.md
* tidy_averages.csv
* this README.md

The 'run_analysis.R' script downloads, merges, and tidies data from the 'Human Activity Using Smartphones Data Set' from the UCI Machine Learning Repository as described in detail in the Method section of CodeBook.md. 

'tidy_averages.csv' is a tidy dataset output from the analysis grouped by subjectid, activity, and summarising a subset of mean feature readings as described in the CodeBook.md. 

I confirm that this is my own work.
